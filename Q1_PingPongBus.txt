Question: How many ping pong balls would it take to fill an average-sized school bus? Describe each step in your thought process. 
I can get a good estimated total of ping pong balls without finding the exact volume of anything. Instead, I can measure the dimensions of the bus in ping pong balls. For example, if the dimensions of the bus are 100 balls * 100 balls * 500 balls, I can guess that the volume of the bus is about 5000000 ping pong balls. I could measure the volume of a seat in a similar way to the bus, because most bus seats can be broken down to a few basic shapes: a vertical box sitting on a horizontal box, supported by four cylinders (the legs are probably not too significant). Then I can multiply this by the number of seats on the bus and subtract that total from my 5000000 ping pong balls. This total would probably be a minimum number of ping pong balls, because it assumes that the balls will not pack together. However, it is probably a fairly good estimate.
