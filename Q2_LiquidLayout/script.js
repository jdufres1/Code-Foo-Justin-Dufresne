		"<b>About Me:</b> From my experience, it seems like a basic part of human nature that " +

		"everyone who plays and enjoys Pokemon has designed their own at some point. You draw " +

		"a picture, write down the attacks it learns and at which levels, maybe " +
	
		"create a fake Pokedex entry for it. The same desire to create, at least " +
	
		"for me, extends to most books I read, movies I watch, and video games that " + 

		"I play. It seems so cool to imagine playing a game that I already love, " +
	
		"but on a map I created, with characters I designed, and a story I wrote. <br /><br />" +
	
		"I think my desire to learn how to make video games sprung out of this " +
	
		"kind of daydreaming. Now that I actually know how to write code, it still " +
	
		"blows my mind every day that I can double-click an icon and play a game that " +

		"I designed from scratch. I'm majoring in Computer Science in college, but, to " +
	
		"be honest, the department here doesn't offer the kind of experience I'm " +
	
		"looking for. Partly it's because my classmates aren't nearly as passionate " +
	
		"about learning to code as I am, and partly it's because the department only " + 

		"has three professors, so there are only so many classes they can offer at once. "  +

		"I'm hope that by participating in the Code Foo program, I'll be able to learn more about " +

		"how video games are made and work with people who are equally as motivated as I am. <br /><br />" +
	

		
		"<b>Favorite Video Game:</b> Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door<br />" + 

		"It's hard for me to really decide on a favorite, but I think the Paper Mario series " + 

		"takes the prize. It's lighthearted and whimsical, but brings in just the right amount " +
 
		"of serious emotion in all the right places, and the writing is absolutely phenomenal. ";
