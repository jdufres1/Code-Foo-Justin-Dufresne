A liquid layout is a layout in which element widths are initialized as percents instead of as absolute values. This means that the elements will be different sizes depending on the size of the window they are contained in or the resolution of the screen. However, the element widths will remain in the same proportion. This means that people using computers with lower resolutions, or those who decide to make the window smaller for convenience, won't have to scroll horizontally to read text or find other parts of the web page.
